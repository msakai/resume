Professional Experience
-----------------------

### [Toshiba Corporation](http://www.toshiba.co.jp/worldwide/index.html)

Engineer (Apr 2007 to June 2015) and Research Scientist (July 2015 to Present):

I worked as a researcher for System Engineering Laboratory,
Toshiba Research and Development Center. I have worked in
software dependability team to develop technology based on
formal methods, program analysis, automatic test-case
generation to achieve more dependable systems. I have also
worked in cities infrastructure solutions team and developed
a recommendation system that recommends brick-and-mortar
shops/goods on smart-phone for regional promotion.

* Economic load dispatch (2015-2016):

  Economic load dispatch is the determination of the output
  of electricity generation units, that meet the electricity
  demands with lowest possible cost, subject to complex
  operational constraints. I assisted research project of
  economic load dispatch problem by removing performance
  bottlenecks of our prototype optimization system, setting
  up continuous integration environment, and writing heuristic
  algorithm and minor modules of the system. My work is partly
  applied to the system for TEPCO Fuel & Power, Incorporated.

  (written in Japanese))

* Recommendation system for Kawasaki Grand City Mall project
  (2013-2015):

  Toshiba carried a demonstration experiment on smart city
  and O2O service around Kawasaki Station (c.f.
  http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2013_12/pr_j1901.htm
  http://www.city.kawasaki.jp/200/page/0000053904.html
  (written in Japanese)). As part of this experiment, we
  have developed a recommendation system that recommends
  brick-and-mortar shops/goods on smart-phone for regional
  promotion. I leaded a team for data analysis and
  recommendation algorithm development.

* SMT-based semi-automatic test-case generation for power
  plant control systems (2010-2014):

  Power plant controllers are often programmed using graphical
  data flow language such as Function Block Diagram (FBD).
  We have proposed new test coverage criteria for FBD and
  developed technology to automatically generate test cases
  that satisfy the proposed criteria. I developed core
  algorithms of our approach that encodes both FBD programs
  and conditions for proposed criteria into logical formula and
  solves the conjoined formula using SMT solvers to generate
  test cases.

* Molatomium (2009-2011):

  I assisted language/runtime design of “Molatomium”, a parallel
  programming model for “Cell Broadband Engine”-like
  heterogeneous multicore processors, which was shipped
  with Toshiba's flagship digital TV “CELL REGZA”.
  (c.f. https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotpar-10/molatomium-parallel-programming-model-practice )

* Specification mining based on UNSAT core enumeration (2008-):

  Specification mining tackles the software maintenance and
  reliability issues by mining latent specification from
  source code. We have developed novel technology to mine pre-condition
  (one type of specification) by combining model checking and minimal
  unsatisfiable core enumeration.

* CForge: Bounded model checker for C language (2008-2012):

  CForge is a C program analyzer based on a program
  analysis framework Forge developed by the Software Design
  Group (SDG) at MIT, and we developed CForge as part of a
  joint research project with MIT SDG. I worked as a main
  developer of CForge, and worked on its overall design,
  design of our formal specification language for C, implementation
  of a kind of C compiler, and so on.

* Verification of work-flow networks based on model checking (2007).

Open Source Activities
----------------------

* toysolver / toysat

  Solver implementation of various problems including SAT,
  Max-SAT, PBS (Pseudo Boolean Satisfaction), PBO (Pseudo Boolean
  Optimization), MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) and
  non-linear real arithmetic.
  In particular It contains a moderately-fast pure-Haskell
  SAT solver 'toysat'. I submitted it to solver competitions
  (Pseudo Boolean Competition and Max-SAT Evaluations) and
  ranked high in some competition categories.

* Ruby-GNOME2

  Ruby-GNOME2 is a set of Ruby language bindings for the
  GNOME >=2.0 development environment. I was one of core
  developers in the early days. In particular I have
  designed/wrote a general bridge between Ruby's object system
  and GObject object system using reflection/introspection
  features and replaced non-extensible hard-coded one in
  its predecessor Ruby/GTK1.

* PTQ : An implementation of Montague's PTQ in Haskell

  Montague grammer and the PTQ (The Proper Treatment of
  Quantification in Ordinary English) by Richard Montague
  were pioneering work in the field of formal semantics
  of natural languages, and showed that natural languages
  (like English) and formal languages (like programming
  languages) can be treated in the similar way. I
  implemented his theory in interactive environment.

  * https://github.com/msakai/ptq

* CPL : A categorical programming language interpreter

  I implemented an interpreter of CPL, a functional programming
  language based on category theory, designed by Prof. Tatsuya
  Hagino. In CPL, data types are declared in a categorical
  manner by adjunctions. Each data type is declared with its
  basic operations or morphisms. Programs consist of these
  morphisms, and execution of programs is the reduction of
  elements (i.e. special morphisms) to their canonical form.
